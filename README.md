# Filling the database

Inside the "database" folder there are 3 sql files which after being executed, filled the database for testing.

-  DDL.sql (Make the role database)
-  DML.sql (Fill the database)
-  TRIGGER.sql (Make the transaction rules of the database)

To run some tests, use content inside the file "SELECT.sql".
